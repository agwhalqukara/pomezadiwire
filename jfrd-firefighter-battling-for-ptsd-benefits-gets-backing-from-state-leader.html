“Sometimes we need to show them that we’ve got their back,” said Jimmy Patronis, who is Florida’s chief financial officer and state fire marshal. “[First responders] have our backs technically 24/7, 365 days a year every time we dial 911.”
Patronis filed an “Amicus Curiae Brief” on July 30. It is also known as a “friend of the court brief” that voices his support for first responders getting benefits for any mental and nervous injuries."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He believes that is getting misconstrued on the local level.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“I know what the interpretation of the law is,” Patronis said. “I know what the intent of the law is and when the law is under attack,&nbsp;I feel like it is my job to stand up and fight for it. We are not trying to weigh in on the character of any of the individuals. We are not trying to be critical of any of the parties. We are just saying that this is the law that was passed by the Florida legislature. This is how we interpreted it on how it is supposed to work.”</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Patterson is appealing the judge’s decision to the Florida first court of appeals.</p><p>Copyright 2022 by WJXT News4JAX – All rights reserved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmpu%2FpXnFoqmenpmctbWx0WaZmqykobavs4yfpqtloKnApXnBnqWenpmpwG6zxK2qZpqRmLiqusZmnaunnWLAta3TnmSlnZGZsrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
