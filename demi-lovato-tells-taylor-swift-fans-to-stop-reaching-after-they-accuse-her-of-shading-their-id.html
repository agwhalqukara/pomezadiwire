Demi posted a story on her IG that read: ‘I skipped the VMA’s for a REASON."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

My REASON for not going is because I am literally living my dream being on Will and Grace rn so stop reaching thaaaannnkksss,’ she wrote.</p><p>But that was not the end of it! Taylor’s fans were not convinced since some tweeted things like: ‘Why do Demi Lovato stans cry about Taylor being petty when Demi’s ALWAYS publicly doing s**t like this?’ / ‘Any of you lovatics try to defend demi f***ing stop. she doesn’t support women. she hates taylor swift for god knows what reason, thinks you’re not homophobic if you know someone gay, and overall is a s**t person. i’m tired of her pulling this s**t and being excused.’</p><p>It totally sounds like Demi denied shading Taylor on her IG story even though she never mentioned her name but it makes sense why people would think she did.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The timing is part of the reason why, but then again, she also sided with her manager, Scooter Braun, amid his and Taylor’s beef as well!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUmrqqecuorZqsn2LBprjLrGStmamhvLN50rCgn6xdm66vv4ytpmarpKS9br7EmpqhoZ6ceqKy056pZqyYmsZurcKcrKydXZ2ys3nOn2SsoJGZtq%2BzjK2fnqGiYralu8tmoKdlnprEbrzOrKtma2Fqf3mCjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
