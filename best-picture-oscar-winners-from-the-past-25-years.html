The entire cast of La La Land took the stage to accept Hollywood’s biggest award in 2017, with several cast and crew from the musical giving emotional acceptance speeches with their statuettes in hand before producer Jordan Horowitz realized the category’s presenters, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, had announced the wrong winner."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Personally, I blame&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Steve Harvey</strong></a></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span class=x_ContentPasted0>for this,” he quipped, referencing Harvey’s similar Miss Universe 2015 flub. “I would like to see you get an Oscar anyway. Why can’t we just give out a whole bunch of them?”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Beatty and Dunaway later explained that they had been handed the wrong card — the one that revealed <a href=#><strong>Emma Stone</strong></a> as Best Actress — which is why the twosome looked confused before announcing the winner.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Beyond now-infamous error, Moonlight’s win was a major event for the Academy Awards as it marked the <a href=#>first-ever LGBTQ film to take the Best Picture prize</a>. While many queer-centered stories have been nominated for the** award — Milk, Brokeback Mountain, Boys Don’t Cry and Philidelphia to name a few — none had ever snagged the statue.</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“There was a time when I thought this movie was impossible because I couldn’t bring it to fruition,” director<strong>&nbsp;Barry Jenkins</strong>&nbsp;said in his 2017 acceptance speech. “I couldn’t bring myself to tell another story. Everybody behind me on this stage said, “No, that is not acceptable.” I want to thank everybody up here behind me. Everybody out there in this room. We didn’t do this. You guys chose us. Thank you for the choice. I appreciate it. Much love.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Kimmel returned as Oscars host the following year <a href=#>and once again in 2023</a>. The late-night talk show host opened up about landing the gig prior to the event, joking that he was only asked back after other hosts declined.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Being invited<a href=#> to host the Oscars for a third time</a> is either a great honor or a trap,” Kimmel told <a href=#>Variety </a>at the time. “Either way, I am grateful to the Academy for asking me so quickly after everyone good said no.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Academy Award executive producers and showrunners <strong>Glenn Weiss</strong> and <strong>Ricky Kirshner</strong>, for their part, said they were “thrilled” to welcome Kimmel back. “We know he will be funny and ready for anything,” they said.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Keep scrolling to see every Oscars Best Picture winner over the years.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BkwKSt0WaZnqukYr2qr9OuqZ6rXWd9coGQcmlobGRngHc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
