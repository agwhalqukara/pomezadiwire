Austin was the son of Jimmy Lee Holt (Steve Bond), who was actually the illegitimate child of Edward Quartermaine (John Ingle).
The Quartermaine family wanted nothing to do with Austin and actively worked to keep Austin from claiming any of the Quartermaine fortune as his own."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Apparently, Cyrus Renault (Jeff Kober) has close ties to Austin’s mother Charity Gatlin (Gloria Carlin). It was revealed that Cyrus even paid Austin’s way through medical school, thus ensuring he became a doctor.</p><p>In return, Austin was forced to work for Cyrus secretly for years. Although Cyrus was in prison, he issued orders through Austin’s cousin Mason Gatlin (Nathanyael Grey).</p><p>When Austin became romantically interested in Ava Jerome (Maura West), Mason kidnapped Ava to get Austin to help get Cyrus released from prison.</p><p><img alt="General Hospital: Dr. Austin Gatlin-Holt (Roger Howarth)" width=800 height=400 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/11/general-hospital-spoilers-ava-must-answer-for-austins-death/ data-jpibfi-post-title="General Hospital Spoilers: Ava Must Answer For Austin’s Death!" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GH-Austin-Holt.jpg></p><h3>GH Spoilers – Austin Gatlin-Holt Was Stuck In The Middle!</h3><p><a href=#>Although Austin seemingly had genuine feelings for Ava,</a> he still was forced to compromise her several times at Cyrus’ command. But Austin had apparently had enough and went to the authorities to reveal the truth about his connection to Cyrus and his criminal empire.</p><p>He wanted to offer a plea deal but the authorities said they needed proof, which Austin left to retrieve at his cabin in Pautauk. But someone shot Austin and left him for dead, destined to bleed out alone in his own home.</p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers – News Of Austin Gatlin-Holt’s Fate Will Soon Spread!</h3><p><a href=#>Once word gets out that Austin was shot</a>, look for suspicion to fall on Ava. She’s been seen many times in public associating with Austin. And now that she knows Austin was working for Cyrus all along, she may have decided to resort to murder to get revenge.</p><p>But it’s much more likely that Cyrus himself shot Austin in order to keep him quiet. Austin’s death may finally give him some validity within the Quartermaine family as well, so look for everyone in Port Charles to have an active interest in who killed the son of Jimmy Lee Holt!</p><h3>What Do You Think?</h3><p>Who shot Austin? Is he really dead? Will the Quartermaine’s finally accept Austin if he dies?
