Dex is working for the PCPD and is intent on helping them build a case against Sonny, and all Joss can do is worry that Sonny won’t let him live another day to earn his badge.</p><p>Bumping into Dex in the park and going for a run with him was the first time in a long time that Joss was able to enjoy his company and remember why she fell in love with him in the first place.</p><p>Is there any chance that her love for him will come to overshadow how disgusted she is that he ever considered killing Cyrus Renault (Jeff Kober) upon Sonny’s order?</p><h2>General Hospital Spoilers — Dex is Still a Good Guy</h2><p>Joss can see the truth in front of her face. She knows that every good thing about Dex wasn’t spoiled by this one mistake he almost made.</p><p>She doesn’t need Trina Robinson (Tabyana Ali) or anyone else to remind her that she still loves him. But that’s different than reconciling her own personal beliefs and deciding to be with a man who was willing to become a murderer all to maintain his loyalty to a guy like Sonny — someone she doesn’t believe to be a good man at all.</p><p><img alt="General Hospital: Dex Heller (Evan Hofer)" width=730 height=521 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/05/general-hospital-spoilers-joss-may-entertain-the-idea-of-parting-ways-with-her-principles-just-to-have-dex-back/ data-jpibfi-post-title="General Hospital Spoilers: Joss May Entertain the Idea of Parting Ways with Her Principles Just to Have Dex Back" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GH-Dex-Heller.png></p><h3>GH Spoilers Leak This May Be a Hill She Will Die On</h3><p><a href=#>Joss is a pretty principled young woman.</a> She’s always tried to hold herself to fairly impeccable standards, especially when it comes to the type of people she spends her time with.</p><p>When Spencer Cassadine (Nicholas Chavez) was behaving badly, she wanted nothing to do with the guy — despite him being her lifelong friend and more or less family.</p><p>Looking back on Joss’ short life, her relationships with Oscar Nero Quartermaine (Garten Stitt), Cameron ‘Cam’ Webber (William Lipton), and even with Esme Prince (Avery Kristen Pohl) showcase just what Joss likes to surround herself with — and what she won’t tolerate.</p><p>The fans keep waiting for her to change her mind and make an exception for Dex, but that wouldn’t track with her past behavior.</p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers — Joss Never Wanted to Be Like Her Mother</h3><p><a href=#>Joss loves her mother, Carly Spencer (Laura Wright),</a> but she also sees her as an imperfect human who has made many mistakes — most of which Carly herself would own up to.</p><p>While she doesn’t think she could ask for a better mother, that doesn’t mean Joss aspires to be a carbon copy of her. Just the opposite. Joss wants to live a life on the straight and narrow.</p><p>She adores Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), but she doesn’t want to be in love with a guy like that. So far, she’s trying to talk herself out of loving Dex.</p><p>Only time will tell whether that works. Joss may finally come to understand why her mother couldn’t just walk away from the men she loved in her life — even if she didn’t love what they did. Stay tuned for more <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital news and spoilers to see how this shakes out.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX91e49uZqCdnpq%2ForiMoaasqJmprq150qmmoqSVp8Buts6sqmalka56prrTnqmtmZmjerW0xGagnZ2RYrynec%2Baqa2hnpx6uK3YrGSwoaSdeqmx0Wanq6GemLaxuMSsZKOto6l6tbuMoZivnV2Zsrl5wZqapGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
