Walmart claims he’s sued previously over the same alleged incident.</p><p>“Mr. Jackson’s allegations are almost identical to a lawsuit he filed against our company in 2021 that was dismissed,” a spokesperson for the company wrote in a statement,&nbsp;<a href=#>according</a>&nbsp;to NBC News.</p><p>Roughly three years ago,&nbsp;Jackson claimed that he was a victim of racial profiling and false accusations that resulted in his arrest.&nbsp;</p><p>He told the court that he suffered emotional stress and pain from the handcuffs being placed on him when he was being arrested, and like the recent lawsuit, Jackson&nbsp;initially sought $100 million and&nbsp;“a huge credit for future shopping”&nbsp;but later revised the complaint to request $175 million in damages.</p><p>Court documents show his case was dismissed shortly after filing due to failure to properly serve Walmart.</p><p>Walmart maintains as a company it does not “tolerate discrimination of any kind.”</p><p>“We intend to defend the company against the allegations once we have been properly served,” the company said. “And will quickly ask the court to dismiss any claims&nbsp;that are without merit.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX91e49qZmpwX6myua3SZqSapl2sv7C6xp%2BspWWRmLC2v8SdZKieXai1sLzLop2toZ6ceritza2qZq%2BRobqivtNmq6hll57DpnnHoqRmaWBlunA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
