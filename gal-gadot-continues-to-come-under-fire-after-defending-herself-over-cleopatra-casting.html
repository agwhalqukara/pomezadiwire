Artists, actors, and entertainers are viciously criticized whenever they take on roles or projects without paying proper respect to the culture which inspired or provided the basis for that role, whether historically or symbolically.</p><p>Scarlett Johansson had her own experiences with this when she was blasted on social media for being cast in a movie in which she would portray a transgender person. Rather than say sorry, Johansson doubled down, at least until she changed her mind and then apologized just a few days later.</p><p>Another actress to face the wrath of social media is <a href=# rel=noopener>Gal Gadot – the Wonder Woman star –</a> who recently went on the defensive against the brigade of anonymous commenters. Hot New Hip Hop picked on some of these comments in a new report, in addition to her response.</p><p>Gal Gadot has been cast as Cleopatra in an upcoming biopic about the Egyptian ruler’s life. When asked by BBC Arabic’s Sam Asi, Gadot explained that Cleopatra was actually from Macedonia so it wasn’t cultural appropriation. Moreover, Gadot suggested she wanted to celebrate her legacy and the legacy of others, regardless of their race.</p><p>Reportedly, the new biopic will be directed by Patty Jenkins who also sat in the director’s chair for the Wonder Woman movies, including the first and the sequel. Film buffs know Jenkins recently made history for helming the most successful film directed by a woman.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CJKcvp9hJmO/</p><p>Of course, this wouldn’t be the first time Gadot has come under fire in the mainstream media. Earlier in the year, amid the beginning of the quarantine lockdown, Gadot tackled a John Lennon cover along with some of her celebrity friends.</p><p>However, it didn’t go the way she intended. Gadot and her friends were blasted by social media for being “out of touch.” <a href=# rel=noopener>They covered Lennon’s classic song, “Imagine,”</a> and users accused them of trying to make the pandemic about them, and also misunderstanding just how important they are to the public.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Later, Gadot touched on the video and said it failed to “transcend.” Social media users have continued criticizing Gadot since the news was announced, and it’s unclear if the actress will step down.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeXlrlus8Cdpq1lk6S7tbXNrpysZaSkeqS7zJ5krqaUmr9ussirnGaZlqmys3nDnp2eppSeu6h5x56prJ2cm3qwwsSrZJyklaS9osDRmmScmaOptq%2BzjG1tb29oa3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
