That was sort of the case with Joseph Ruskin. The man had been acting for most of his life, and he pretty much been in everything. From classic shows like Twilight Zone to amazing movies like Prizzi’s Honor, the man was a staple in Hollywood. It is with heavy hearts we announce the passing of legendary actor, Joseph Ruskin.</p><p>Joseph Ruskin was born in Massachusetts (shout out to my home state) and spent many years in the Navy before pursuing an acting career. He was also integral in the SAG (Screen Actors Guild) which has made a huge difference in the working rights of actors and actresses for decades now<a href=#>. CNN has more on the prolific man and his remarkable career.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;You may think you don’t know the name, but we could show you his body of work and we guarantee you have seen him in something before.</p><p>Joseph Ruskin died of natural causes in a hospital in California this weekend. We pass along our genuine condolences to his family and friends in this tough time. Losing someone who is so integral in Hollywood for so long is never easy, but that is why we are taking &nbsp;a moment to give this man the credit he deserves.</p><p>Image via David Zaugh/SAG-AFTRA</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiYnKyfp3qru9Kep6FloqrArLXNZpuinaNirrV5l3Jm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
