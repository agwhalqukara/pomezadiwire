Even Hans Kim from four months ago claims in a YouTube video that he checked his girlfriend into a <strong>$68</strong> motel. He performed it while sporting two watches, too! Although the video has 550 views, we are unsure if it is a factual story or simply a comedian's joke. Sometimes, these comedians only invent stories to amuse the audience.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/04/hans-kim-girlfriend-1.jpg alt="Hans Kim is still single as of 2023." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><strong>Hans Kim is still single as of 2023.<br></strong><strong>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>There is nothing about Hans Kim's romantic life on social media. A charming man who enjoys having a good time is reserved with his potential love interest. The queer comedian who promotes love and acceptance has chosen to keep his relationship a secret—or is he maybe still single? He appears to be single as of 2023. Yet, the comic might be having a covert relationship. Unless he mentions something about his love life, we can't be sure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGifmqajYriquYygoKuklqe2prrDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
