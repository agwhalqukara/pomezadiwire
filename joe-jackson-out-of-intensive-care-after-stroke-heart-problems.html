The source says Jackson is regaining his motor skills and starting to walk with assistance. Doctors believe he will be able to enjoy full regular meals once he regains energy.</p><p>Following his hospital stay, the insider says Jackson will fly back home with his famous daughter Janet via her private jet. The family, including his children <strong>Randy</strong> and <strong>Rebbie</strong>, currently have plans to leave together. He will then be transferred to a hospital in L.A.</p><p>As previously reported, the Jackson family patriarch suffered a serious health scare in Sao Paolo on his 87th birthday. "Yesterday in Sao Paolo, Joe had a stroke and then his heart stopped," his publicist told Us Weekly on Monday. "He was at an event and he was feeling light-headed and dizzy… They found out there was something wrong with his eye. There was an artery that burst behind it."</p><p>While doctors ran some tests, a complication arose. His publicist said that Joe's heart stopped for 10 seconds before he was revived. "He had one stroke and then his heart stopped three times," the publicist told <strong>Us</strong>. "I don’t know if they’re calling that a heart attack, but officially they said one stroke and his heart stopped three times."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Joe penned a statement on his website following the scary moment. In it, he thanked his fans, family, friends, and doctors. "God willing, I should be able to make a quick recovery and travel back home soon. Thank you all once again for your prayers and support," he wrote at the time.</p><p>Still, his publicist said recovery would take time. "So far he’s doing okay, but he’s not out of the woods yet," the rep told<strong> Us </strong>this week.</p><p>This isn't the first time the head of the Jackson family has suffered a stroke. He's suffered three previously, including one in November 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGonV2frqS30qilZqelqXqwsoyipa2dnqi2t7GMnJirnV2Ws7Wx0WaqraqfoLJutMSaqa1loKe8o7jEpqpmamBmgnR9lg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
