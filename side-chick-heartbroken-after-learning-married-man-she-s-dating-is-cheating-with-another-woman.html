I just found out he’s cheating on me and his wife with a new woman. What should I do?" she asked.<p class=align-left>The woman did not disclose how she learned about the third woman, but she was shattered to learn that the man had been juggling two illicit relationships simultaneously.</p><h2>Karma caught up?</h2><p class=align-left>Most responses from social media users were harsh towards the complainant, with many viewing it as karma.</p><p class=align-left>Alec Schwartz:</p>"He isn’t cheating on you, you’re freaking delusional and dumb to think that if he was capable of cheating on his wife that he wouldn’t go behind your back as well. Karma caught up to you."<p class=align-left>Mark Albano:</p>"You don’t have a “relationship” with this man. Just like the other woman, and it is likely that there are even others."<p class=align-left>Renee Terry:</p>"He is not cheating on you and his wife with a new woman. He is cheating on his wife with you and the new woman. The best thing you can do right now is gather up every stitch of your dignity and get out of this scenario."<p class=align-left>Diane Read:</p>"The cheater is being cheated on. You knew better than to commit adultery with a married man. So now that he's cheating on you, you're asking for advice?
