— Good size and frame for an NFL edge and appears to have long arms.
— Has impressive speed to win around the edge as a pass-rusher.
— Shown a handful of pass-rush moves he can win with, including a rip, cross-chop, long-arm and arm-over.
— Solid bull-rusher who keeps his legs moving through contact to collapse the pocket against weaker offensive tackles."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Struggles to time up the blocker's punch and knock their hands down.</p><p><b>2023 STATISTICS</b></p><p>— 14 G, 42 TOT, 10.5 TFL, 8 SK, 1 INT, 1 TD, 1 PD, 3 FF</p><p>— Born Oct. 25, 2001</p><p>— 2023 second-team All-SEC (AP)</p><p>— No major injuries</p><p>With Will Anderson Jr. in the NFL this season, Chris Braswell finally got an opportunity to get a significant amount of playing time at Alabama, and he made a name for himself as a pass-rusher. He put up good numbers, ranking second on the team in sacks behind Dallas Turner, primarily because he can win in multiple ways.</p><p>Braswell has shown the ability to win with pure speed around the edge and has solid to good bend to help turn a tight corner. He also has a fairly deep pass-rush arsenal with the moves listed above and is a decent power rusher, as he keeps his legs pumping through contact. He also recognizes when he's reached the point of no return—or level with the quarterback—and uses his countermoves to work back inside.</p><p>However, Braswell's run defense isn't up to par. Alabama often kept him on the sidelines on running downs. He isn't very physical at the point of attack, and he appears to lack upper-body strength, which makes it difficult for him to get extension on blocks. He's also slow to key and diagnose run plays and has questionable lateral movement skills, which will lead to him getting reached in the NFL.</p><p>Overall, Braswell would be a good fit for a team that's looking for a standup outside linebacker who can contribute as a situational pass-rusher.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 7.1 (High-Level Backup/Potential Starter — 3rd Round)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK</b>: 72</p><p><b>POSITION RANK</b>: EDGE7</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Joseph Ossai</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWqDdoCMnJ%2BroaNir7Ot0rCcpaRdo7OtecOrmJ%2BsXWd9c4CMrJqoraSeu6h50Z6nqKqkYrOwvoytmKaokWKvosWMm6ycm5Gjsqa%2B0macnZ%2BV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
