You are the pinnacle of the most beautiful family and we cannot imagine the devastation of your loss,” wrote donor Jen Steinberg.</p><p>“The amount of love, healing, and peace we are sending to you all is endless. With every bit of our heart may it help to heal the smallest piece of yours.”</p><p>Fellow donor Samantha Nasello echoed, “Our family has been heartbroken by your loss. May you be surrounded by love and support during this time and may his memory forever be a blessing.”</p><p>According to a Facebook post by Sportime Rosyln, Falkowitz and Hassenbein were best friends who began playing tennis together at the ages of 5 and 6. By the time they reached 14, the post said, the boys were “two of the top players on Roslyn’s High School’s varsity tennis team, the top team on Long Island.”</p><p>The GoFundMe description has not yet been updated with which charities the family will choose to donate to in honor of their late son.</p><p>To donate to the GoFundMe, click <a href=#>here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This continued to be a developing story.
