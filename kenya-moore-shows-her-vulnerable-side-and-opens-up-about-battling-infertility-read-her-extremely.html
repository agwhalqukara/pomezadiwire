I suffered from uterine fibroid tumors so big they became the size of a full-term baby. My struggle was televised for all to see. I was even made fun of for not having a child.<br>I wished I had a way to connect with other women that were going through the same issues. I had so many questions, and a doctor just couldn’t be there for me emotionally. I cried so many times after doctor visits… test results,’ Kenya began her post.</p><p>She continued and told people: ‘I didn’t have anyone to talk to that really understood. I often felt alone and depressed. I wanted to know why me… For women who are trying to conceive and can relate to these feelings, @peanut‘s app has a community for you. Traditionally just for mothers and those expecting, it’s so refreshing to see @peanut expanding their app to women on fertility journeys. It’s a space to meet, talk, listen, and share, so you don’t have to be alone.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5lMobgHkZS/</p><p>Kenya ended the message with: ‘As you can see from the beautiful photo that I gave birth to a healthy baby girl, but the journey wasn’t easy. Download the app today, and share your journey with other compassionate people.’</p><p>Shamea said: ‘Aaaah, that’s so sweet of you to share your journey and be so vulnerable.❤️ BLESSED’</p><p>Claudia Jordan posted this: ‘That was so damn evil when those girls came for you about not having a baby and those gross & tacky egg comments. Now, look at you. You have the most beautiful and amazing baby girl of all! Watching you and your experience have more women hope than you’ll ever know @thekenyamoore. ❤️❤️’</p><p>Someone else said: ‘No matter how crazy everyone gets on that show any real human being would be happy for you and this baby of yours… Especially given all that what you went through with your mom, I am happy you get to push the reset button and show the world And your daughter especially –what it means to be a great mom.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>And these are just a few of the really loving and supportive messages that Kenya received following her opening up like this.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebmru6rYympqiqlWLAqbvWrGShnaJiw7a4zZ6pmpqcmnq0tcOeZJqmlGK8sbHNrGSuqF2Wr7DB02aZmqykobavs4yipZ%2Bdoqm2rbXTsmSrnZGZeqmx0WacsayimrqmuNhmnKanpJ68r63LZqSeq6OWtKZ5km1uaWxmZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
