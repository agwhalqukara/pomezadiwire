&#34;My sister was heavy into drugs, and we would have to go and get her from crack houses,&#34; Shepherd, 41, says.
At the time, the stand-up comic — then a Jehovah's Witness — was &#34;in a very physically abusive relationship,&#34; she said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She said her self-esteem became so low, "I felt if someone killed me, it wouldn't even make a difference." But after converting to Christianity, she said, "God showed me that it would make a difference." (Shepherd has also said she relied on her faith to get through her split with husband <strong>Jeff Tarpley</strong>, father of their 3-year-old son. During their seven-year marriage, Tarpley cheated on her and got another woman pregnant.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Still, Shepherd admitted it is tough talking religion on the popular ABC chat-fest. (She received criticism after she once remarked that ancient Greeks persecuted Christians, even though Christ hadn't been born yet.)</p><p>"Oh, sometimes I say, 'Lord, Juanita Bynum or Joyce Meyer would be so good at this table. They could lay hands on <strong>Barbara Walters</strong> and get her saved,'" she said. "I ask the Lord, 'Why am I here?'" Shepherd added. "I have to trust God when He says, 'Because I said so.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqhnaKntm6%2Fx56noZ2imXqqeceam2aln6eybq3BqKmtoZ%2BjwG7Ax5qlZqFdrLy2uMNmo6KjlWLBsHnCqKynrF1nfXGEkWtu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
