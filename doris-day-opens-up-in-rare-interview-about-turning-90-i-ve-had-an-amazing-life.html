It’s a different world.”</p><p>But that doesn’t mean Doris has been kicking back and taking it easy in recent years.</p><p>“My days are busy responding to the huge volume of mail I receive,” she tells Closer. “I’m still floored by all the beautiful, heartwarming letters from people all over the world, telling me that my work somehow touched their lives.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/calamity-jane.jpg> Doris in 1953’s Calamity Jane<p>At 90-years-old, Doris says she’s still going strong! “Oh, I have my little aches and pains now and then, like everyone. But I’ve truly been blessed with good health,” Doris tells the mag.</p><p>“I love to be outside, walking along the beach or working in my garden. Those things are all quite enjoyable for me. I have everything I could ever want right here in Carmel!”</p><p>For her 90th birthday plans, Doris will hold a “doggie fashion show to showcase local rescues that need homes” on April 3rd at the Cypress Inn, the pet-friendly hotel she owns in Carmel.</p><p>But in characteristic style, the superstar refused to make this event all about herself, insisting it also be a fundraiser for her charity, the Doris Day Animal Foundation.</p><p>“I’ve never been a fan of celebrating my own birthdays,” she tells Closer, adding that “helping animals has been a lifelong passion. They give us unconditional love and ask very little in return.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/doris-day-portrait.jpg><p>“All I ever wanted in my life was to get married, have kids, keep house and cook, and even though I did all these things, I still ended up in Hollywood,” she jokes . “It was a great trip. I’ve had an amazing life and wonderful times. And I’m happy!”</p><p><strong>For more from Doris Day including several never-before-seen photos of the star, pick up the new issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8OoqaKrXZmuunnOqZynq12qvW61zWapmqqVYravwMSrraKdp2Kuo7vUrWStraKjtq%2BzjHJnZqFdq7JutMCdZJqmXZa6osbIp55mpJmbsm5%2FlXBpcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
