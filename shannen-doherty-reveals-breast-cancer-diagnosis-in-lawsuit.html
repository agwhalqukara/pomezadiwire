The actress announced the news in, of all things, a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Aug. 19.</p><p>The papers, obtained by <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, revealed that the Beverly Hills, 90210 alum, 44, discovered recently that she had invasive breast cancer, which spread because, she argues, she was not properly covered by her health insurance. According to Doherty’s suit against Tanner Mainstain, her former business management firm failed to procure insurance premiums through Screen Actors Guild in a timely manner.</p><p>“In November 2013, SAG sent the premium invoice to Tanner Mainstain for Plaintiff’s medical insurance coverage for the year 2014,” the suit read. “However, Defendants ignored it, failed to pay it (without informing Plaintiff) and then promptly terminated their relationship with [Doherty] effective February 7, 2014.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Doherty was fired by Tanner Mainstain, leaving her uninsured and unaware of that fact. The Charmed actress later re-enrolled with SAG’s insurance in 2015, which is when she learned of her cancer diagnosis. “Plaintiff was also informed that, had she been insured and able to visit her doctor, the cancer could potentially have been stopped, thus obviating the need for the future treatment (including mastectomy and chemotherapy) that Plaintiff will likely have to suffer through now,” the documents alleged.</p><p>Doherty went on to slam <strong>Tanner Mainstain </strong>for unethical practices. “In truth, the firm and former partner [Steven] Blatt specialize in fleecing actors and entertainment industry professionals,” the complaint read. “After gaining control of all of their clients’ cash and assets, they find a way to lose it, sometimes by gross incompetence, sometimes by self-dealing and outright theft. Along the way, they habitually deceive their clients, going so far as to set up bogus transactions, to conceal their misdeeds, errors and omissions. The firm has hallmarks of a Ponzi scheme.”</p><p>Doherty’s husband, Kurt Iswarienko, is also suing the accounting firm and Blatt, claiming that they mismanaged the couple’s assets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqhmZ6jsq95w6ifnqqkrnqzsdWemKWrXZe%2Fpq3SrWScmZ6YsrN5w6KYoKafqLa0ecinZKWZp6jCqsCMa2dqbWFuhQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
