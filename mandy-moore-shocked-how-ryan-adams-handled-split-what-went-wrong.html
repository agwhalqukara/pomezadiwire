A source tells <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> that the Walk to Remember actress was "totally shocked" by how estranged husband <strong><a href=#>Ryan Adams</a> </strong>handled their split. Moore was the one to file for divorce, and her rep confirmed the split to Us on Jan. 23.&nbsp;</p><p>"They specifically discussed her filing," the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>, explaining that the discussion of divorce then sent Adams into high gear to attempt to resolve the marriage. "He was desperately trying to make it work up until the days before he filed," the source says.</p><p>In court documents obtained by Us Weekly, in which Adams filed for a dissolution of their marriage on Jan. 23, he listed their date of separation as Aug. 4, 2014. However, the insider tells <strong>Us</strong> there's no truth to the date. In fact, it's "coming from there being no prenup and is financially motivated."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Now that Adams has officially filed, the former pop star is still trying to take the high road. "She had been unhappy for awhile. She tried to make things work and eventually she just had to walk away," the source tells <strong>Us</strong>. "She's trying to keep things civil but is pretty upset about the way he's handling this.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Us</strong> confirmed last week</a> that the couple of six years have called it quits. "Mandy Moore and Ryan Adams have mutually decided to end their marriage of almost 6 years," the couple said in a statement to <strong>Us</strong>. "It is a respectful, amicable parting of ways and both Mandy and Ryan are asking for media to respect their privacy at this time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSappSueq67zqucZquYpLCsscNmn6ivXafGorqMmpuapaNitaK6w6WcnWWjpbmqwIywn5qsXayyr8CMsKmoppdif3F9lGxoag%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
