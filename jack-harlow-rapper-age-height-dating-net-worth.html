Jack was a local star during high school and frequently performed to packed <a href=#>houses</a> at Louisville venues, including Mercury Ballroom, Headliners, and the Haymarket Whiskey Bar.

The Homies, made up of Louisville rappers and producers Ace Pro, 2forwOyNE, Shloob, Quiiso, and Ronnie Lucciano, opened for him on his subsequent 14-day Gazebo Tour. He worked on his upcoming songs in 2018 and 2019, acquired a contract with Atlantic Records and Dj Drama, and dropped his significant first mixtape, “Loose.” Following the release of many singles, Harlow issued “Confetti,” a 12-track mixtape featuring Bryson Tiller, 2forwOyNE, and EST Gee.

When the two of them were spotted together at the BET Awards in June 2021, rumors began circulating. With Saweetie, who had broken up with rapper Quavo just a few months before June, Jack looked to have tried to “act like a gentleman” with an uninterested Saweetie.</p><p>According to rumors, Jack had an affair with Addison Rae in April 2021. When they were observed at a boxing fight in Atlanta the same month, the myth got its start. Addison liked many of Harlow’s posts on social media and followed her for a time. The public may have been misled into thinking they were dating, given how frequently they were seen together at the time.
