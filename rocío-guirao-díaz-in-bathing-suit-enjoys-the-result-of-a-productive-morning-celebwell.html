She is so into fitness that she even has her own ap. "I work 3 times a week in fitness gym and twice a week aerobics in dance classes. I love working my abs and my buttocks, is where I put more emphasis," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Women Fitness</span></a><span>. "It kicks off today! No more excuses," she </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>captioned</span></a><span> a recent clip from her workout session.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Roc√≠o also eats very healthy. "As a family we lead a very healthy life, we do not do diets but focus on eating healthy and healthy," she told Women Fitness. However, "on weekends we are 'allowed' food of choice, but during the week we are strict with our food."</span></p><p><span>Roc√≠o also maintains a very active lifestyle and loves hiking. "Finally together," she captioned a photo taken in front of a waterfall with her friend after hiking to the gorgeous place. Some of the physical benefits include building stronger muscles and bones, improving your sense of balance, improving your heart health, and decreasing the risk of certain respiratory problems. It also offers many mental health benefits, according to a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Stanford University</span></a><span> study.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Roc√≠o is a fan of the (workout) buddy system. "We are what we repeatedly do, so excellence is not an act but a habit üí™üèª. Check out my partner </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>@carosuki</span></a><span>," she captioned one of her workouts alongside a friend. "<span>Getting at least seven hours of sleep each night benefits your health in many ways, and exercise can help. People who exercise regularly tend to fall asleep more quickly at bedtime (spend less time falling asleep) as well as spend less time lying awake in bed during the night. If you've had a poor night's sleep for any reason, you might feel too tired to exercise. If that's the case, try taking a nap (ideally before 3 p.m. and for only 20 to 30 minutes) and exercise afterward," according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Harvard Health</a>.</span></span></p><p><span>Roc√≠o adjusts her diet based on her needs. "During my pregnancy I strived to eat healthy but honestly as one must increase food intake, in each pregnancy I gained 20 kilos," she told Women Fitness. "After having my babies, I got started on a cardio and aerobic exercise routine that helped me lose weight. Also decreasing the amount of food I eat helped me normalize my routine."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkq6eTnrxus9SiqZqnXZm2osaMoqVmmpGptaq6xmaqrqGkYrKvts6yqmasmJp6s7HSrqOtZZ%2BbeqJ5z6umna2Tqba3sYympqummaO0cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
