As I come from a pretty conservative part of the country it’s common that anyone different from the majority can still be seen as ‘outcasts’. I wanted to write songs which normalise being different, and shine a light on anyone struggling with fitting in.”</p><p>“My mission has always been to use my voice in contributing to a world more open for diversity, and I believe the best way is often to treat what’s “different” as the most natural thing in the world. So all the songs for this project are written so they can be relatable to most people, even though the pronouns might not always be as what’s expected.”</p><p>With the hopes that their music will “foster acceptance of diversity and help those who feel misunderstood or mislabeled regardless of sexual orientation”, the special extended play is set to be released Friday June 2nd 2023, followed by the album “Eden” later this year.</p><p><strong>Listen to “Stuck In The Middle Of Nowhere” below:</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Long before he experienced the dizzying heights of international fame as a much loved member of <strong>KEiiNO</strong>, Tom Hugo was making his mark across Europe, as a solo singer-songwriter, enjoying great success following a string of musical releases and radio-hits in Norway and Germany.</p><p>However it was following the bands storming appearance at the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest that Hugo, along with band members <strong>Alexandra Rotan</strong> and <strong>Fred Buljo</strong>, reached the top of the charts with the trio’s monster hit “Spirit In The Sky”.</p><p>To date KEiiNO releases have secured Tom 110 million Streams, 5 platinum certifications, many awards and a Norwegian Grammy (Spellemann) nomination.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Stuck In The Middle Of Nowhere” is available to download / stream now.&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Let us know your thoughts on Tom Hugo over on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a> now!</strong></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kwbC5jKGsoKddmsWxuM6rnKxllpqyrbXNoKpmp5ZitrS7y5qroqeeYq6vsIylpqednJ67pr%2FSZqafZZ6axG6%2FzqWmZquZo7StsYysq66bm2K2r3nToZxmpZmZsa2xjKidZqafrLWmvsRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
