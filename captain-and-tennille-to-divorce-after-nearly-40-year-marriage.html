"I don't know why she filed," he said, adding that they are still living together. "I gotta figure it out for myself first."</p><p>Dragon and Tennille toured with the Beach Boys, as keyboardists, in the '70s. They later began touring as a duo, and released their first album, Love Will Keep Us Together, in 1975. Some of their hit tracks include: "Do That To Me One More Time," "Muskrat Love," and "The Way I Want To Touch You."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In a September 2010 <a href=#>blog post</a>, Tennille announced that Dragon suffered from a neurological condition similar to Parkinson's that caused tremors and made it difficult for him to play keyboards. "Some days he does pretty well…. other days his playing is severely compromised," she wrote.</p><p>Captain & Tennille's <a href=#>website</a> was recently updated with a message about their split. "Until Thursday, January 16th, 2014, when Toni Tennile met with a DIVORCE ATTORNEY, in Phoenix, AZ, everything relating to THE CAPTAIN & TENNILLE appeared to the public as them being the ideal model for a 'rock-solid' married pair," the statement read. "But almost all people naturally evolve over time, & sometimes hidden feelings start to be uncovered when one may read, just a little more into (the popularized, substitute heading appearing just below), stating, for instance: 'MUSIC HAS KEPT THEM TOGETHER.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqaqKSWtq95wKebZqyVo7uquMueZJ%2BhnJp6p7vRZpuirp%2BnsKZ506ilomWkmruvtculnGaZnpl6pa3RsqNmnKKWtLC6jK2mZp2emXqurdGroJqflWKup8DEq2SnnZGnubp5k2lksp2Rp8Bufo9qa2trYQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
