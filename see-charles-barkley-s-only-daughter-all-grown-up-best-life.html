At the same time, he was also the father to a young daughter. <strong>Maureen</strong> and Charles Barkley welcomed <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>their daughter, <strong>Christiana Barkley</strong></a>, in 1989. Now, their only child is a 32-year-old who has a career of her own and is newly married.</p><p>While she keeps her life pretty private—she has no public social media, for example—Christiana's wedding was covered by the New York Times, her mother has shared photos of her online, and her famous father has talked about her in interviews. In fact, he shared quite a bit about the wedding, including his fear of participating in the hora. So read on to find out more about what Charles Barkley's daughter is up to today.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Dennis Rodman's 18-Year-Old Daughter Just Made Sports History Twice</a>.</strong></p><p>Christiana married her now-husband <strong>Ilya Hoffman</strong> on Mar. 6, 2021. The pair got married in Scottsdale, Arizona, where Christiana's parents live. In the New York Times <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>article about the wedding</a>, Christiana and Hoffman explained how they met.</p><p>Hoffman, who is not a sports fan, was invited to a bar to watch a Villanova University basketball game, and Christiana, a Villanova alum, was in attendance. While some people at the bar were talking about how Christiana is the daughter of an NBA star, Hoffman had a different response.</p><p>"I said, 'Oh, you mean the guy from Space Jam?' That's where I knew him from. Some people might have been like, 'Oh my god, Charles Barkley.' To me it was like, 'Look at this amazing girl.'" They continued to bond when Hoffman invited some of the group to hang out as his apartment afterward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Charles-Barkley-JKL.png><p>Charles approved of Hoffman and told the New York Times that he was "really emotional" when Hoffman asked for his blessing. But, there was one part about the wedding he was worried about. Hoffman is Jewish, and Charles was afraid to participate in the traditional hora.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>During <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Charles' appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a> days before the wedding, host Kimmel noted that it looked like the former basketball player had lost weight. "I've been really working out hard, because, apparently, they got to pick me up in a chair," he explained. "I need all Jewish people on deck, brother. I can only get so skinny by Saturday."</p><p>In the Times story, Christiana shared what ended up happening. "He really was scared, but he got in the chair, and next thing you know he and my mom were up there. They had a blast."</p><p><strong>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><p>As the Times story notes, Christiana works for The Koppelman Group, where she is the director of writing and a senior account manager.
