Two of Houston's starters, Luis Garcia and Lance McCullers Jr., are injured. Their ace, Justin Verlander, turns 41 in February. Seeking pitching depth for a team that has its lineup mostly locked in makes a lot of sense, especially an Astros team in win-now mode.</description></item><item><title>Tina Fey, Amy Poehler's Best Golden Globes Jokes: Cosby, Clooney, More</title><link>/tina-fey-amy-poehler-s-best-golden-globes-jokes-cosby-clooney-more.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tina-fey-amy-poehler-s-best-golden-globes-jokes-cosby-clooney-more.html</guid><description>The ladies are back!

In legal terms, past injuries are pre-existing conditions, and are not recoverable after an accident.
