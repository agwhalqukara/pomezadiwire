The most he’s earned on a movie to date was Blade Runner 2049, with a massive $10 million. Other top movies such as La La Land and The Nice Guys have also netted him several million apiece.</strong></p><p>Read on to learn more about Ryan Gosling and his big-time Hollywood salaries.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Starting Out Small</h2><p>Reportedly, Ryan Gosling’s first-ever Oscar nomination was for a movie with pitiful earnings. In 2006, Gosling took the lead in a movie called Half Nelson <a href=# rel=noopener>and received just $1,000 per week of filming</a>. The movie took just twenty-three days to wrap, meaning he was paid around $3,000.&nbsp;</p><p>This movie earned Gosling his first Academy Award nomination a year later, in 2007. He was put forward for Best Actor, and although he didn’t win, it was a fine reward for a payment so small. It was <a href=# rel=noopener>one of the lowest earnings for an Academy Award nominee</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When Gosling’s career began in the early nineties, he didn’t start acting for a pittance. Although he wasn’t pulling in top-tier salaries, he was substantially compensated for his work. Reportedly, his first declared earnings were on the 1995 movie The Tale of Station 109.1, for which he was paid $2,000.&nbsp;</p><p>If you fast forward just five years, Gosling was earning around $50,000 per movie. He’d climbed the ranks exceptionally fast, such was his talent. He was sought after and the mid-2000s would come to be his most successful period. <a href=# rel=noopener>His first million-dollar salary was in 2004, with The Notebook.</a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>There were a few lower salaries as the 2000s continued</a>, which is to be expected. Sometimes, actors have to take lower salaries to secure work. They’ll give the work their all though, as proven by Gosling’s 2006 Oscar nomination. It doesn’t always matter about the money, at the end of the day.</p><p>In 2017, Gosling hit double figures. He pulled in ten million dollars for his role in Blade Runner 2049. This film was critically acclaimed, and Gosling starred alongside the likes of Harrison Ford and Jared Leto.</p><p>You can see the trailer for Blade Runner 2049 below, in a video taken from YouTube.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Born To Act</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Gosling has reportedly wanted to be an actor since he was a very young child</a>. He’d been inspired when he was just a few years old and performed from a young age. It’s said that his sister was a performer, and she encouraged him to take to the stage. He began working on things like impressionism and accents around the same time.</p><p>In 1993, Gosling secured a role in a show that would come to be prestigious for young actors. He signed on a two-year contract with Disney, for appearances on The Mickey Mouse Club. Although he wasn’t too regular on the show, he did learn a lot about acting there.&nbsp;</p><p>He wasn’t alone when it came to other future big names. Also on The Mickey Mouse Club were the likes of Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera. It’s reported that Timberlake and Gosling became very close friends, <a href=# rel=noopener>a relationship that parted after several years.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Ryan Gosling has enjoyed a fairly long and storied career. He’s appeared in some brilliant roles, and has remained quite positively reviewed through the years. He was nominated once again for an Academy Award in 2017, once again for Best Actor. He’s also been nominated for BAFTA and Golden Globe awards. In 2018, he won the Golden Globe for Best Actor.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also a small discography. Gosling has been known for his singing over the years, and has featured on three tracks over the years. These were all released as part of movie soundtracks but didn’t ever perform too well in the charts.&nbsp;</p><p>Temporarily, back in 2007, Gosling formed a fledgling band. <a href=# rel=noopener>This venture was named Dead Man’s Bones, but it was a very small side project</a>. Although he released an album, it never charted and the band rarely – if ever – put on shows. Gosling had quite an interest in the band though, – he went on to learn a string of instruments for the sole purpose of recording.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqGmsGWdqrCpecOonKxloq6ur3nGqKqloZ6ceq6typ5kqZ2iYrqwwsieZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
