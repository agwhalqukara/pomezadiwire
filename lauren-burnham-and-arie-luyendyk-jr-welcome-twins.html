Oh my gosh, that’s so cool.’</p><p>This comment came after Lauren had also joked that if they were to have twin girls, he would be greatly outnumbered in the home.</p><p>The parents were also super excited and relieved since this pregnancy followed a heartbreaking miscarriage.</p><p>‘This time around has been different to say the least. The darkness that surrounds a loss is really something not easily forgotten. The months of mourning, months of hoping, to now, to moments of worry. Even in the midst of something as beautiful as a new life, that darkness still finds its way in to then remind me that it did exist. It has tarnished the blissful ignorance that I gleefully experienced the first time around. With all that said, I am proud of this body and what we have endured together,’ she said in part, at the time.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Congratulations Lauren and Arie!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeclsKzsc1mma6qnp2urnnAp5tmmaKesm641LKcp5ypoHqrvoywnKWbn6KybsDWoqWsZWRugHeEmGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
