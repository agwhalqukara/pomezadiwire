"I do work out every day," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Body + Soul</span></a><span>. "It's like anything in life: when you want an amazing result, you have to do amazing things to get there."&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/GettyImages-1419557919.jpg><p><span>Kyly does a 30- to 60-minute weights session in the morning. Her trainer has pushed her to lift heavier weights, and three months into their workouts she was lifting 110kg on the leg press.&nbsp;</span><span>"When you're trying to really sculpt your body – and let's be real, we're talking about getting to the millimetre now, not the centimetre – that's when you need an expert in that area to help you," she told Body+Soul.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/GettyImages-1418162250.jpg><p><span>Kyly does a HIIT (high-intensity interval training) session each week, with moves like box jumps, kettle-bell swings, leg raises and sled-push sprints.

"I wanted to show [Kelsey Lee] that being fit and healthy will help you mentally as well. We have really good, nutritious foods."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/GettyImages-1401718482.jpg><p><span>Clarke also told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mamamia</span></a><span> that she loves cooking healthy meals. "My go-to lunch is tuna, avocado and beetroot lettuce cups," she said. "I love them. Quick and easy and healthy. Add some chilli flakes, salt and pepper for taste." For dinner, she opts for protein-rich meals "I love making honey and soy lean breast chicken in a salad full of goodness like chickpeas, quinoa, corn, tomato, onion, feta and pine nuts," she says.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/KylyClarke6.png><p><span>Kyly loves barre workouts. "Barre exercises offer so many benefits," she said in a workout video for </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Nine</span></a><span>.
