They abuse their power, they show their true colours and you can see them spiralling out of control. You come to your senses and see they aren’t so ‘super’ after all. I wrote it as an anthem for women who have felt men took advantage of them in their position.”</p><p>Listen to ‘Superman’ below.</p><p>‘Superman’ follows on from RuthAnne’s previous single <a href=#>‘Love Again’</a>, which gained a million streams in its first month.
