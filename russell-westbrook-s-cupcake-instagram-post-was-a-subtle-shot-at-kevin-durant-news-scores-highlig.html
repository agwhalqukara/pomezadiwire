One post innocently went under the radar initially—but now it's front and center.
Back on July 4, Durant announced his decision to leave Oklahoma City for the team that had just knocked him out of the playoffs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Also on that day, Westbrook posted a photo of USA-themed cupcakes, which just appeared to be his way of celebrating Independence Day:</p><p>As it turns out, that was a subtle jab at his former teammate.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interesting piece in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Illustrated</a>, Lee Jenkins revealed that it was no coincidence Westbrook featured cupcakes in the post. The term "cupcake" was used in the Thunder locker room as an insult:</p><p><span>Westbrook and Durant were not best buds, but they were peerless partners, a souped-up Stockton and Malone, transporting a mini market to the big time. Westbrook’s closest friends are actually former high school teammates, long-standing wing men like Donnell Beverly and Demetrius (Juice) Deason, who flank him in summer pickup games and play dominoes with him on the Fourth. “He didn’t talk much about what happened,” says Beverly. Westbrook didn’t disparage Durant. He didn’t judge him. All he did was take a picture. When Kendrick Perkins played center for the Thunder, he called teammates “cupcake” if he thought they were acting a little soft. Westbrook and Durant adopted the term in jest. Westbrook posted a bittersweet pic on Instagram: three plates of cupcakes topped by red and blue stars and sprinkles.</span></p><p><span>Now it all makes sense.</span></p><p><span>Westbrook and Durant formed a dynamic duo for eight years in Oklahoma City. While they may have developed a bond together, there are obviously some hurt feelings in the relationship as a result of the former NBA MVP's free-agent decision. And thus, a rivalry has been born.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9vYGqGcXnRrqqsnZyherix0q2Zq6efoMBur9SpmpqjlWK2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1ivbC%2F02aumqtdlnq0wcGto55lo528tXnArWSknaaeu26w1KuYp6w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
