Matteo loves his dad. And not only does Matteo need his daddy, I need daddy. Artem’s so helpful around the house with Matteo and it was a night and day difference for me.’</p><p>The new mom told the news outlet that their 7 month old now sleeps all throughout the night, which has obviously made things easier for the parents.</p><p>Furthermore, this also means that Nikki and Artem get more time to spend with just one another!</p><p>So how do they keep the romance alive in quarantine?</p><p>Nikki dished that ‘You forget how important date night is, even on the couch. We watch The Bachelor on the couch together every week and we get our food ready, get our drinks, and do it in bed. We get so excited and it’s totally given us this spark. We can have mommy daddy time and we don’t have to worry about waking up Matteo. I just feel like we’re kind of back where we were before Matteo came in this world.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>As for the wedding, she mentioned that they are still hopeful it will take place this fall but they have nothing planned yet.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeenristYybnKWkkWLAosXSZp%2Beql2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uw8itn2aZoqmyrnnAn6ueql2ZxLW%2FjKKqZqufYrq2r8dmmZ6spJq%2FbrrIoJ%2BtZZGjsW6wwLJkbXBgZX91ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
