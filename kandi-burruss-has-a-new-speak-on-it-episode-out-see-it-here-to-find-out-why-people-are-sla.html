Go to my Youtube page KandiOnline to hear my thoughts about tonightâ€™s episode. I thought tonight was a great episode. All I can say is B-I-T-C-H! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚What did you think? ðŸ—£ #SpeakOnIt #RHOA,â€™ Kandi captioned her post.</p><p>Someone said: â€˜Kenya is truly miserable on so many levels not just with her married life but her life growing up she continues to look for reasons to shade her friends cause sheâ€™s not coming to reality of her own issues she should not be on the show cause she isnâ€™t Genuinely happy for anyone cause sheâ€™s not happy within.â€™</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6ZiNz_FRQ7/</p><p>Another follower said that â€˜I think you took it a little overboard. She was shocked, and it all came together.â€™</p><p>A follower said: â€˜Kenya lacks common sense and self-awareness ðŸ˜« nobody with common sense would spoil the surprise for their friend, she doesnâ€™t even realize how silly she is, and I honestly see why her fiancÃ© acts the way he does, heâ€™s honestly disgusted by her. ðŸ˜’â€™</p><p>Someone else said: â€˜I could not believe Kenya would behave like this. Starting to see why Nene feels the way she does about her.â€™</p><p></p><p>A follower said: â€˜I didnâ€™t even see the full episode yet, but I respect that even though Kenyaâ€™s your girl, youâ€™re not afraid to check her when sheâ€™s wrong. Thatâ€™s a real friend.â€™</p><p>Someone else also addressed Kenyaâ€™s move and said: â€˜OMG!!!! I just watched the episode tonight, and I got so mad watching that part where Kenya pretty much ruin the surprise of the proposal. I had someone do the exact same thing to me, when my husband was planning his proposal to me, and it made me so mad because of course after someone says something like that to you, youâ€™re always wondering when is he going to pop the question and it puts you on edge for no reason. I think she did it on purpose!!!! ðŸ™„â€™</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Have you seen yesterdayâ€™s RHOA episode?
