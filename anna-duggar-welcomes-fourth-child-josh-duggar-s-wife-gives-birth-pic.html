Josh's younger sister, <strong>Jessa</strong>, is expecting her first child later this year with new husband <strong>Ben Seewald</strong>.</p><p>Married since 2008, 19 Kids and Counting couple Josh and Anna announced their pregnancy in December, and confirmed their daughter's gender four months later. "This time of the year, there's so many things we're thankful for," Josh said in the video, surrounded by his pregnant wife and three children. "From my sisters getting proposed to and married, to all the fans who are watching at home."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple's happy news comes after a tumultuous time for Josh and his extended Duggar family. In May, the Duggar family confirmed that Josh, now 27, had molested four of his sisters — including <strong>Jill</strong> and Jessa — and a family babysitter when he was 14.</p><p>"Twelve years ago, as a young teenager I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret," he said in a statement on May 21. "I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation…I sought forgiveness from those I had wronged and asked Christ to forgive me and come into my life."</p><p>News broke on Thursday, July 16, that TLC <a href=#>will be canceling&nbsp;</a><a href=#>19 Kids and Counting</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJinppFisbazxpqpZq%2BVobCwucSsZJ%2BnpafBqXnCoaClnF2fvLS0jJ2soJ%2BRp8Buw8ifnGafmauytHnBoqmtoF1nfXKBkHJu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
