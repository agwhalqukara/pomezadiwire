On the print's whitespace, it reads, "Be + Solange, 8 years [and] 3 years."</p>&nbsp;<p>Set against a gold background, the shot shows an 8-year-old Beyonce in a retro red outfit with her arms spread out. The future Destiny's Child superstar cozies up to her little sister, who wears an animal print top and sports an adorable smile.&nbsp;</p><p>"Happy Birthday to my sis!" Beyonce captioned the photo. The two have been outspoken with their affection for one another as of late, closer than ever after <a href=#>Solange's infamous NYC elevator fight with <strong>Jay Z</strong></a> in May 2014, which Beyonce witnessed. "I love you deep."</p><p>Mrs. Jay Z went on to share another photo in honor of Solange's big day. Posted without a caption, the image shows Solange holding Beyonce and Jay Z's 3-year-old daughter <strong>Blue Ivy</strong>. Solange grins as the little girl dabs an eyeshadow brush on her aunt's eyelid.&nbsp;</p><p>Solange <a href=#>previously Instagrammed</a> the same photo with little Blue in honor of her niece's birthday in January, writing at the time, "My twin, my fellow sassy pants, my dancing partner, my incredibly smart, beautiful, niece-y-poo, turns 3 today! I love her so much."&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm very proud of my sister and protective of her," <a href=#>Beyonce told Essence of Solange in 2003</a>. "Solange is the one person I will fight for. Don't talk about my sister; don't play with me about my sister. If you do, you'll see another side of me. I admire her, and though she's five years younger than me, I strive to be like her. She's so smart and secure. She's sensitive to people's feelings, but not afraid of what they think."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmesZ%2BjsKZ5wp6jnpqilsGmv4yspqWZnpyytHnBoqmtoJSWxm7DyK2fZpmUpL%2BirsueZJygmaGxqbvOnWSpoJ%2BpvG5%2Bj2psa2xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
